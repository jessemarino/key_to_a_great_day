# Key To a Great Day

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create a calander that would keep my notes in local storage so I can see them even if I leave the page. My motivation for this was to make something to help me keep track of my homework assignments and other notes while attending school. The time blocks are color coded with grey meaning that it has went past that hour, red meaning that it is the current hour, and green meaning that hour has yet to come.
